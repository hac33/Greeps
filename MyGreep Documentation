public class MyGreepextends Greep
A Greep is an alien creature that likes to collect tomatoes. Rules: Rule 1 Only change the class 'MyGreep'. No other classes may be modified or created. Rule 2 You cannot extend the Greeps' memory. That is: you are not allowed to add fields (other than final fields) to the class. Some general purpose memory is provided. (The ship can also store data.) Rule 3 You can call any method defined in the "Greep" superclass, except act(). Rule 4 Greeps have natural GPS sensitivity. You can call getX()/getY() on any object and get/setRotation() on yourself any time. Friendly greeps can communicate. You can call getMemory() and getFlag() on another greep to ask what they know. Rule 5 No creation of objects. You are not allowed to create any scenario objects (instances of user-defined classes, such as MyGreep). Greeps have no magic powers - they cannot create things out of nothing. Rule 6 You are not allowed to call any methods (other than those listed in Rule 4) of any other class in this scenario (including Actor and World). If you change the name of this class you should also change it in Ship.createGreep(). Please do not publish your solution anywhere. We might want to run this competition again, or it might be used by teachers to run in a class, and that would be ruined if solutions were available.
